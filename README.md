# # Route RecSys Code for Chapter 5
</div>

This repository is created for Chapter 5 of the thesis titled 'Towards Context-Aware Recommender Systems for Tourists'.


# Abstract 

The chapter presents the last piece of the evolution of this thesis. This work proposes a new CARS algorithm to recommend tourist routes in a city, using dynamic contextual data sources from platforms like Google Places API and  Weather Underground API. The study collected and filtered photos from popular locations in Europe discarded user-generated information, and created routes based on specific rules. We also scraped data from the Google Sightseeing website to gather popular places and contextual details, which were mapped along with the check-in information. Our experimental evaluation shows the difference between contextual data used to create routes.
 

# Getting Started
  
  You need Python 3.7 and higher to run the codes and you need the latest version of the following packages to run both codes and jupyter notebook. The list of this package is in the requirements.txt file. Please use pip to install it.
 
	numpy, 
	pandas,
	matplotlib,
	sklearn,
	jupyter,
	fastread, 

	Files and their usage

	codes -- Contains codes to run algorithms. main.py is the location where everything starts.
	datasets -- Contains the latest version of the datasets for two cities
	evaluation -- Contains experiment results
	notebooks -- Contains notebook for data analysis and exploration.
